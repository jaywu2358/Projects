<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
<h1> About The Project </h1>
<img src="https://github.com/jaywu2358/Shared-Shopping-List-Web-Application/assets/106934206/d71bb11c-e5de-4c3d-ab40-68b812aeca43"/>

This is the first full-stack web application that I developed using Java, Spring Boot, REST APIs, PostgreSQL, and Vue.js. It allows you to create shopping lists to keep track of the items/quantities to buy in the list. You have an option to create a group and invite people to this group to manage the lists with you. You can also "Claim" a list so that other people in your group know that you will buy the items in this list. 

### The functionality of this app can also be turned into:

1. An "Order System", where "List" becomes "Order", "Group" becomes "Service Providers", and "Claim" becomes who is going to fulfill the order. 

2. A "To-do List Tracker", where "List" becomes "To-do list", "Group" becomes "Workers", and "Claim" becomes who is going to do the task.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## How to use the app?

1. Register for an account. Note: Even though this is just a practice project, the password is HASHED for your safety.

</br>
</br>
2. Create a list for yourself.

</br>
</br>
3. Add/Modify items. Made a mistake? Simply modify the item. It also shows you the "timestamp" as well as the "modifier", which is really handy when the list is shared in a group.

</br>
</br>
4. Create a group, and invite a user to the user.</br>

5. After you invited a user/received an invitation to join a group. The Group Invitations show you both information there. The First row is the invitation the current user sent to "user 6" to join "group 1". You need to share the invitation code with the user being invited. The second row accept/decline a invitation to join "group 4".

</br>
</br>

6. Create a list in the group. Note: only the user who created the list can see the "delete" button. Claim a list. The user who "Claimed" the list can "unclaim" it. Other users can only see that the list has been "Claimed".
